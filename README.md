# myBookReview

This is an example of a book review app I made that allows users to see average ratings of a curated list of tech-related books and add their own reviews and ratings to each book.

Pictured here is what the home screen looks like showing some of the many books listed in the app.

After clicking on the Add Review button, the user is shown this screen that allows them to add their own review and star rating by hovering over the stars.
